# Inectio Lite

Inectio is a lite weight dependency framework for small and upto mid range projects. If your project is more than mid range I would prefer to choose Zenject or StrangeIoc.

Inectio is designed from the experience of StrangeIoc framework (MVCS). Inectio doesn't have any inbuilt design such as MVCS or MVVM etc. So you can your own design pattern on top that you can apply dependency injection using Inectio.

Core Features:
 - Core Binding
 - Injection (Property, Field, Method) (Doesn't support for constructor injection).
 - Signal
 
Upcoming Features:
 - Listen Attribute (where you can add listeners to singals using one line)
 - Constructor injection support
 - Commands
 - Auto Enable and Auto Disable signals (based on gameobject active).
